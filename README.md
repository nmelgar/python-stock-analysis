# Python Stock Analysis

This project is a Stock Analysis tool developed to enhance my skills as a software engineer. The purpose of this project is to analyze historical stock market data, visualize trends, and evaluate stock performance using Python. The software extracts stock data, calculates key financial indicators, and generates visualizations to aid in investment decision-making.

Data is being used from [Yahoo Finance's](https://finance.yahoo.com/) API.
